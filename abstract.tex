Linear Meld is a concurrent forward-chaining linear logic programming language where logical facts can be asserted and
retracted in a structured way. The database of facts is partitioned by the nodes of a graph structure and concurrency is achieved by
executing nodes simultaneously. Communication arises whenever nodes send facts to other nodes by fact derivation.
We present an overview of the virtual machine that we implemented to run Linear Meld on multicores, including
code organization, thread management, rule execution and database organization for efficient fact insertion, lookup and deletion.
Although our virtual machine is a work-in-progress, our results show that Linear Meld is not only capable of scaling graph and machine
learning programs but it also exhibits some interesting performance results when compared against other programming languages.
