We have presented a parallel virtual machine for executing forward-chaining linear logic programs, with particular focus
on parallel scheduling on multicores, rule execution and database organization for fast insertion,
lookup, and deletion or linear facts.
Our preliminary results show that the VM is able to scale the execution of some programs when run with up to 16 threads.
Although this is still a work in progress, the VM fairs relatively well against other programming languages.
Moreover, since LM programs are concurrent by default, we can easily get better performance from the start by executing
them with multiple threads.

In the future, we want to improve our work stealing algorithm so that each thread steals nodes that are a better fit
to the set of nodes owned by the thread (e.g. neighboring nodes).
We also intend to take advantage of linear logic to perform whole-program optimizations,
including computing program invariants and loop detection in rules.
