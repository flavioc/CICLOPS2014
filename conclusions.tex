We have presented the LM language and described how the VM is implemented, including
parallel scheduling on multicores, rule execution and database organization for fast insertion,
lookup, and deletion or linear facts.
Our preliminary results show that the VM is able to scale problems reasonably well when run with up to 16 threads.
Although this is still a work in progress, the VM fairs relatively well against other programming languages.
Moreover, since LM programs are executed in parallel, we can easily get better performance from the start by executing
the program with multiple threads.

In the future, we intend to take advantage of linear logic to perform whole-program optimizations,
including computing program invariants, loop detection in rules and bypass of rule priorities. For instance,
we want to detect during compile time which might be the best data structure for each predicate depending in how it
is used in the rules.
